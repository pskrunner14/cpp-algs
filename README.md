These are C++ implementations of various algorithms and data structures optimized and modularized for peak performance and extensibility. This project includes support for C++11 std and can currently only be built on Linux.

## Getting Started

You need to have any recent C++ compiler with C++11 support and [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/) installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pskrunner14/cpp-algs.git
cd cpp-algs/
./install.sh
```
